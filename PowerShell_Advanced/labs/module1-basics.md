# Lab: Configuring Windows PowerShell, and finding and running commands

## Scenario

You're an administrator who'll use Windows PowerShell to automate many administrative tasks. You must ensure that you can successfully start the correct Windows PowerShell host applications and configure them for future use by customizing their appearance.

You're also preparing to complete several administrative tasks by using Windows PowerShell. You need to discover commands that you'll use to perform those tasks, run several commands to begin performing those tasks, and learn about new Windows PowerShell features that'll enable you to complete those tasks.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- **OPTIONAL** Open and configure the Windows PowerShell console application.
- **OPTIONAL** Open and configure the Windows PowerShell ISE application.
- Find and run Windows PowerShell commands.
- Use Windows PowerShell Help and About topics to learn new shell concepts and techniques.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Lab Setup

Virtual machines: **AZ-040T00A-LON-DC1** and **AZ-040T00A-LON-CL1**

User name: **Adatum\\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

## Lab Startup

1. Select  **LON-DC1**.
1. Sign in by using the following credentials:
   - User name: **Administrator**
   - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
   - Domain: **Adatum**

1. Repeat these steps for **LON-CL1**.

## \[OPTIONAL] Exercise 1: Configuring the Windows PowerShell console application

### Exercise scenario 1

To customize Windows PowerShell, you need to first make changes to the console. In this exercise, you'll open the Windows PowerShell console application and configure its appearance and layout.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Start the console application as Administrator, and pin the Windows PowerShell icon to the taskbar.
1. Configure the Windows PowerShell console application.
1. Start a shell transcript.

### Task 1: Start the console application as Administrator, and pin the Windows PowerShell icon to the taskbar

1. On **LON-CL1**, start the **Windows PowerShell** application as **Administrator**. Make sure that the window title bar reads **Administrator** and doesn't include the text (x86). This indicates that it's the 64-bit console application and that an administrator is running it.
1. Pin the Windows PowerShell icon to the taskbar.

### Task 2: Configure the Windows PowerShell console application

1. Open **Windows PowerShell Properties**, and then configure Windows PowerShell to use the **Consolas** font with **16**-point size.
2. From the **Colors** tab, select alternate display colors for the primary text and background.
3. From the **Layout** tab, size the window to fit on the screen and remove any horizontal scroll bar.



### Exercise 1 results

After completing this exercise, you'll have opened and configured the Windows PowerShell console application and its appearance and layout.

## \[OPTIONAL] Exercise 2: Configuring the Windows PowerShell ISE application

### Exercise Scenario 2

In this exercise, you'll customize the appearance of the Windows PowerShell ISE application.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Open the Windows PowerShell ISE application as Administrator.
1. Customize the appearance of the ISE to use the single-pane view, hide the **Command** pane, and adjust the font size.

### Task 1: Open the Windows PowerShell ISE application as Administrator

1. Right-click the **Windows PowerShell** icon on the taskbar or activate its context menu, and then open the **Windows PowerShell ISE** application as **Administrator**.

### Task 2: Customize the ISE's appearance to use a single-pane view, hide the Command pane, and adjust the font size

1. Configure the ISE to use the single-pane view and display the console pane.
2. Hide the **Command** pane.
3. Adjust the font size so that you can review it comfortably.
4. Close the **Windows PowerShell ISE** and the **Windows PowerShell** windows.

### Exercise 2 results

After completing this exercise, you'll have customized the appearance of the Windows PowerShell ISE application.

## Exercise 3: Finding and running Windows PowerShell commands

### Exercise Scenario 3

In this exercise, you'll use Windows PowerShell’s **Get-Help** and **Get-Command** commands to discover new commands that can complete specific tasks within Windows PowerShell. You'll also run several basic Windows PowerShell commands. In some instances, you might have to find the commands that you'll use to complete the task.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Find commands that'll accomplish specified tasks.
1. Run commands to accomplish specified tasks.

### Exercise 3 results

After completing this exercise, you'll have demonstrated your ability to find and run Windows PowerShell commands that perform specific tasks.

## Exercise 4: Using About files

### Exercise Scenario 4

In this exercise, you'll use help discovery techniques to find content in **About** files, and then use that content to answer questions about global Windows PowerShell functionality.

Remember that you must use **Get-Help** and wildcard characters. **About** files aren't commands, **Get-Command** will not be useful in this exercise.

The main task for this exercise is:

- Locate and review **About** help files.

### Task 1: Locate and review About help files

- Ensure that you'll still signed in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** from the previous exercise, and answer the following questions:
