   * Trial Account **(Credit Card Required):** https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ ***This is not generally used in class***

  - Once you are at the AzurePass web site https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/
    - Click Start (if needed)
    - **Make sure** the email address listed on the web page is the **new outlook.com** email address you just setup in the previous step
      - **if it is not**, logout and login as the new outlook account on this same website before continuing

    - Enter the AzurePass Code that was emailed to you
