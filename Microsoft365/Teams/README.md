# Microsoft Teams: glossary of Teams terms
A team is a collection of people working towards a shared goal or employed to deliver a function.

**Teams** are built on **Microsoft 365 Groups** – the foundational membership service that drives all teamwork across Office 365.

A team includes the content and tools to enable the goal or function and is typically either:
-	Project-based, e.g. launching a product
-	Department or location-based – e.g. your customer service team or Belgian office

Two types of Microsoft Teams.

## Public Team:
One that is open to anyone in your organisation – up to 10,000 people – to join. They don’t need someone’s approval to join it.

**Note:** You can easily change a public team to private, and vice-versa.

## Private Team:

Invited members only – the team’s owner adds and removes them. Currently (August 2020), a private team is not visible to everyone in your organization, but in future, there will be the option to make private teams discoverable – Manage discovery of private teams in Microsoft Teams.
 
## Microsoft Teams Channels

A team comprises of **channels**; they are where the work gets done. When you create a team, you get a channel called ‘General’ by default. And it’s always first; you can’t delete it or change its name.
As the name suggests, you can use the General channel to discuss routine and ad hoc matters concerning the team.
To give order and structure to your team’s activities, you can add other channels, for example, by topic, department or project.

Channels allow you to:
- Collaborate with team members via:
- Online conversations – known as persistent chat
- Audio and video calls
-	Scheduled meetings
-	Impromptu meetings, with Meet now
-	Announcements – which stand out from the conversation (more later)
-	Share external emails – forward emails to your channel. Get the channel email address by selecting the ellipsis (row of three dots) beside it.
