> [!IMPORTANT]
> Now that the labs are provided by Skillable it is important to have the students follow the lab steps
> provided in the online lab instructions.
> Some PowerShell code is required for the course, the code is in the instructions but is not able to be
> directly added into the labs, hence it is important to teach the students how to paste text from the host to
> the lab using the lightning bolt icon in the top left corner of the lab window

## Lab 12 

> [!WARNING]
> With changes to the free trials for MS365 subscriptions from Microsoft this lab is no longer viable
> as the free trail now asks for payment methods, so it appears the once the trial period ends (after 30 days)
> the subscription will convert into a paid account
