# Understanding PowerShell Objects

```PowerShell
# Whenever a command outputs information it is always in the form of an Object
# The Get-Member command shows you the three major parts of the object created by the Get-Date command:
# - The ObjectType
# - Properrties in the object
# - Methods in the object

Get-Date | Get-Member
