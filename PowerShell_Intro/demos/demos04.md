# Using the help system

```PowerShell
# To discover how to use a PowerShell command use the Get-Help command

# For example to understand all of the parameters that are associated with the Get-Service command run the following command:
Get-Help -ShowWindow -Name Get-Service

# For the help that is available online
Get-Help -Online -Name Get-Process

# For help with concepts in PowerShell read the About help pages, for example:
Get-Help -ShowWindow -Name About_Objects 
```
