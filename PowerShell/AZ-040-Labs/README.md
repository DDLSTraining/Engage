# Lab instructions rewitten by Brent Denny

## These labs solve the following issues

- The original labs showed only answers 
- The lab questions are not published in the course manual
- The lab questions are only available via LODS 
- The labs answers did not include any hints for students to help them find their own answers
- Some of the lab content has bugged me for years, so my rendition has changed these labs to be more inline with real life
- The labs constantly used shortcuts and aliases to instruct students even though in the course they suggest not to use aliases
- Hints and answers are now only available if a student requests tem by clicking on the hint or answer
- Hints and answers are in markdown code blocks that allows easy copying and pasting from these labs 

# Because the AZ-040 labs have internet access students just point to this engage site to access their labs

# This site completely replaces the need for the students to use the LODS lab instructions and the Microsoft Learning Github for answers

# I hope you find this useful.
